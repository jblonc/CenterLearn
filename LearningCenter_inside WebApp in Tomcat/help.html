<u><span style="background-color: #00FF00">To generate a new user id:</span></u>
Type the ID into the the box 'Enter LnCtr ID', click 'record' button; the
student can now logon using the ID and the password '<span style="background-color: #FF00FF">learningcenter</span>';
when logged on, the password can and should be changed by the student (It's
recommended that email address without domain address serves as Learning Center
ID, but it can be anything else that distinguishes students)
<p><u><span style="background-color: #00FF00">To enter the time a student comes
in:</span></u> Type the student's ID into the box 'Enter LnCtr ID'; (must)
select a course name from the dropdown; (must) select a professor; click
'record' button. This automatically registers the current time as the student's
coming-in time; if the current time is not the student's coming-in time, simply
adjust the time next to 'Start Time'. The date in 'Start Time' must be today's
date (so don't do anything about the date). <font color="#0000FF">If the student
doesn't already have an ID, this also automatically creates an ID for the
student.</font></p>
<p><u><span style="background-color: #00FF00">To enter the complete record of a
student's visit:</span></u> Type the student's ID; (must) select a course name;
(must) select the professor; choose 'Start Time'; switch <u>'End Time? No'</u>
to '<u>End Time? Yes</u>'; choose end time; choose a tutor (optional); click
'record' button. The dates for start time and end time must be the same,
however, they don't have to be today's date. The end time must be later than the start time. <font color="#0000FF">If the student doesn't already
have an ID, this also automatically creates an ID for the student.</font></p>
